# Gunak Data Management Web App
### Setup development environment
1. You need node version 14.16.*
2. Ensure that Make utility is available.
3. Run `make deps` to install all JavaScript package dependencies.
4. Run `make test` to run unit tests.
5. Run `make start-nhsrc`. This will launch the web app in your browser which would try to connect to the Gunak server running locally.
